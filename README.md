**Summary**
---
This repo was thought as a "personal playgound" for the Finite Element analysis based on the Navier-Stokes equation, describing approximately the flight of a Pterodactylus under certain conditions.
The final work was conceived as a team project, available at: https://github.com/ScarpMarc/NMPDE_2022_CMS

***Disclaimer***: Do not try to run the code, it will probably return errors. As specified above, this one was simply a sandbox for another - already completed - project
